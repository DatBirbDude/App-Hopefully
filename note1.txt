This is 00:33 Sam.

Come in Vincent.

We will be failing this project.

I don't know what I'm doing.

You don't know what I'm doing.

I don't know what you're doing.

Ben doesn't care what we're doing.

But I got a soot for cheep today.

I think it looks nice.

Was only like $300.

I'm currently sitting here, not understanding sockets.

Send help.

Maybe I should use HTTP protocol.

I don't need sockets.

I just hate HTTP.

But it would do the job better.

I'll go learn HTTP for python.
