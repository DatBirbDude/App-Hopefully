This directory is for the server-side implementation of Star Light, under no circumstances should you attempt to run the code in here.

The server is designed to run silently off of glitchtech.top, maintained by greenturtle537. You can reach me at support@glitchtech.top 
or at greenturtle537@mail.com. Also look for me on the cemetech.net SAX chat on late nights.

All code in this directory is built and tested on a Debian 7.8 [Wheezy] machine from 2011 (Yes I know it's 2023), running Python 3.6
on an i386 (Probably 32-bit) architecture. 

Do not modify code in this directory without making a request. If you make changes, please get in contact with me so that I can 
manually restart the server. I am not providing any kind of ssh keys at this time for obvious security reasons.

All of my server software is provided under no license or warranty. It's my intellectual property, but you'd be the one stupid enough
to think it was worth saving or running. I'm so bad at programming that I unintenionally write viruses into perfectly mediocre code.
